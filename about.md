I enjoy making websites that are clean and functional.

My skills range from UI/UX design to front-end development. I am always keeping up with the latest web technologies and design trends. Currently, I am a front-end web developer and designer at a Magento Hosting and Development company.

My specialties include HTML, CSS, Responsive Web Design, Graphic Design, Magento, Wordpress, Jekyll, Javascript, and Jquery.
